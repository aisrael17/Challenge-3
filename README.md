# Challenge-3: Bitcoin Arbitrage Analysis with Pandas

## Technologies
For this project, I used Python3 and the following external libraries:
* pandas
* Path (from pathlib)

## Data
For this project, 2 datasets were provided with minute-by-minute Bitcoin exchange data from Bitstamp and Coinbase. Both datasets included the following variables:
* Timestamp (January 1, 2018 at 12:00am through March 31, 2018 at 11:59pm)
* Open Price
* High Price
* Low Price
* Close Price
* BTC Volume
* USD Volume
* Time-Weighted Price

In my analysis, I only looked at the Timestamp and close prices.

## Project Description
For this challenge, we looked at arbitrage opportunities between Bitstamp and Coinbase Bitcoin exchangese on different dates during 2018. The punchline is that an arbitrage existed early on in the year, but later disspated into February and March.
